## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here - your persona, use case, purpose, audience and goal(s) are thoughtful and very well defined. Although your direction is that of a general purpose developer portfolio - I do take note that you have gone into very specific detail in regards to crafting your Persona and Use Case. 

You have thought these details through in a way that specifically describes the kind of people you are looking to work with - companies and individuals that appreciate and value your technical background in addition to your web development skills. I also take note that you've specifically described a small yet well established company with dedicated and experienced HR staff that does scientific and technically focused work. This is excellent because it serves as a very good reference point and guide for you to design a portfolio site that not only serves the needs of a certain kind of user, but also ultimately serves YOUR needs as a discerning job seeker that brings experience to the table and knows his worth. I'm looking forward to seeing the UI design ideas and content strategy that you come up with in Milestone 2a.

Your HTML looks great, and your project has been set up perfectly. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu, and I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your HTML is indented 1 level too deep beginning on line 21. Really not a huge deal, but something to be aware of. Overall your markup is excellent!
