## Milestone 1 Feedback
Excellent work here - your persona, use case, purpose, audience and goal(s) are thoughtful and very well defined. Although your direction is that of a general purpose developer portfolio - I do take note that you have gone into very specific detail in regards to crafting your Persona and Use Case. 

You have thought these details through in a way that specifically describes the kind of people you are looking to work with - companies and individuals that appreciate and value your technical background in addition to your web development skills. I also take note that you've specifically described a small yet well established company with dedicated and experienced HR staff that does scientific and technically focused work. This is excellent because it serves as a very good reference point and guide for you to design a portfolio site that not only serves the needs of a certain kind of user, but also ultimately serves YOUR needs as a discerning job seeker that brings experience to the table and knows his worth. I'm looking forward to seeing the UI design ideas and content strategy that you come up with in Milestone 2a.

Your HTML looks great, and your project has been set up perfectly. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/). Go ahead and read the documentation on bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu, and I will be going over [Milestone 2&alpha;](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/) in class on Monday 5/1.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your HTML is indented 1 level too deep beginning on line 21. Really not a huge deal, but something to be aware of. Overall your markup is excellent!

Nice work on your wireframes - you've put thought and consideration into your layout choices and content strategy. I do have some suggestions and questions that might help before you begin your development process.

I notice that there is not a navigation option included on the mobile wireframe. The most straightforward option would be to use the Bootstrap built-in navbar which will collapse on the **sm** breakpoint.

It might be worthwhile to think about how you would like to present your Professional Experience, Publications and Portfolio content in more detail. Often a simple paragraph is not sufficient to outline content like a professional history, timeline, or set of skills - so think about how you might need to format and present _your unique data_, and how this will affect your HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap classes.

Would a tabular format be more desirable, or a text box with a thumbnail, or some other kind of specialized UI element or graphic? The more intricate the UI element the more intricate your HTML and CSS needs can be - so plan accordingly.

The same idea goes for your Portfolio section - how would you like to format these little sections? Bootstrap has a [thumbnail](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#thumbnails) component that might be useful.

 One thought that I had is instead of interspersing your social media icons throughout your content, how about grouping them together in one location that is easily accessible? Perhaps in the navigation/header, or in the footer? This may be a cleaner approach.

 Another thought that I have is perhaps to experiment with the visual flow of your layout a little. What I mean by this is instead of having all of your page content left-aligned in the layout, play around with alternating the left-aligned sections with center-aligned sections, or even right-aligned sections in a way that engages the eye in a more dynamic way. You can create visual momentum here by playing with the layout of the sections. I haven't talked about this in class - but in web design there are what are known as "F- Pattern" and "Z-Pattern" layouts. (I think a Z-Pattern would work well for you here!) Google these terms for some ideas. :-)

Overall very nice work here - I look forward to seeing your project take shape! Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP. Build your layout directly inside the `/public_html` directory. You do not need to use the `/documentation` directory any more.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't forget to use the `alt` attribute on your `<img>` tags.
- The correct `lang` value on your `<html>` tag is `en` not `eng.`
