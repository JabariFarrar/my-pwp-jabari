				<p><em>Professional Experience:</em> I would like to list my professional experience so that the user can see my work history and the breadth of my responsibilities.</p>
				<p><em>Publications: </em> By showing my publications, this is a way of legitimizing what I have done in academia and in industry. Many companies would like to see what sort of peer-reviewed articles you have published, which is used as a vetting process for many employers.</p>
				<p><em>Portfolio:</em> The portfolio will serve to show potential employers that I am serious about coding and give them examples of my work.</p>
